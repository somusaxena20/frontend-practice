    - %
    - vw, vh (vw => viewport width   vh => viewport height)
    - em, rem
    - vmax, vmin

----> layout of website
    - absolute vs flex

    - display flex
    - aliging items in x & y axis
    - flex direction
    - flex wrap



**************************************
some imp prop ==============>

vmax -> view port max in certain point it stop considering using width so now it's cosiding based on height
vmin -> viewport min 

em -> it is depends on parent size 
default value of 1 rem is 16px
